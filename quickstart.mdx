This guide walks you through sending your first mobile top-up using simple `curl` commands.

## 1. Get your API key
Sign up and enable API access from the [settings page](https://oneclickdz.com/#/settings). Copy the generated key.

## 2. Check service status
Make sure the API and operators are available.
```bash
curl https://flexy-api.oneclickdz.com/v2/ping
```

## 3. Validate your token
Confirm that your key works before making other requests.
```bash
curl -H "authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://flexy-api.oneclickdz.com/v2/validate
```
A successful response returns your username and key details.

## 4. List available plans
Fetch dynamic and fixed plans to know which `plan_code` and amounts you can use.
```bash
curl -H "authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://flexy-api.oneclickdz.com/v2/plans/listAll
```

## 5. Send a mobile top-up
Replace the values below with a real `plan_code`, phone number, and optional `ref`.
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"plan_code":"PREPAID_DJEZZY","MSSIDN":"0778037340","amount":100,"ref":"my-order-1"}' \
  https://flexy-api.oneclickdz.com/v2/topup/sendTopup
```
The API responds with `topupId` and `topupRef` for tracking.

## 6. Check top-up status
Poll the status until it becomes `FULFILLED` or `REFUNDED`.
```bash
curl -H "authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://flexy-api.oneclickdz.com/v2/topup/checkStatus/REF/my-order-1
```

For ADSL or 4G cards, use the corresponding `/v2/internet/*` endpoints instead of the mobile ones above.
