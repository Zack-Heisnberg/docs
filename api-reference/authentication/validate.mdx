Confirm that your `authorization` token is valid before using other endpoints.

```bash
curl -H "authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://flexy-api.oneclickdz.com/v2/validate
```

```json
{
  "username": "demo",
  "apiKey": {
    "key": "...",
    "isEnabled": true,
    "type": "PRODUCTION",
    "allowedips": [],
    "scope": "READ-WRITE"
  }
}
```

- `400` – token missing
- `401` – token invalid
- `403` – too many invalid attempts, IP blocked
