description: Secure requests with access tokens
---

All API calls require an `authorization` header that contains your access token.

## Sending the header
```bash
curl -H "authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://flexy-api.oneclickdz.com/v2/validate
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the key from your dashboard. If the header is missing or incorrect, the API responds with:

- `400` – access token missing
- `401` – invalid access token
- `403` – too many invalid attempts, IP blocked

Always keep your token secret and rotate it if you suspect compromise.
